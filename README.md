Hello there.

This is a personal learning project for Python. I am attempting to replicate a calculator and add additional functionality to it as a personal project.

The calculator is written as much as possible in Python to give the learning experience needed.

Roadmap:

0.1 Alpha: 2 numbers

0.2 Alpha: 3 numbers

0.3 Alpha: 4 numbers

0.4 Alpha: Any number of numbers

0.5 Beta: Basic GUI

1.0 Release: Working GUI with Skin

2.0 Release: Ability to change skin

I acknowledge it is a simple project but I feel it is a good stepping stone as it has a goal in mind and able to confirm functionality versus the Windows calculator and real-life versions.

Thank you for reading about this.
